  title: Display completed roles
  description: "Completed Roles are not visible, and if a Completed Role happens to\
    \ be the longest-running role on an offering, it can appear to the unaware user\
    \ that the shaper offering bar should be trimmed, and if the user does that, they'll\
    \ be warned that they're gonna trim an allocation, but they're gonna click past\
    \ it because they know better, and there's probably gonna be some ramifications.\
    \ \n \nWe can probably make the warning modal be more specific or make it add\
    \ Completed Roles to the Included filter so they can see what they're trimming.\
    \ \n \n \nCopied from Repro Steps when changed from Issue to Bug\nHave one role\
    \ on a project run much longer than the rest of the offering roles \nMark the\
    \ role completed \nObserve that black offering bar appears to have an errantly\
    \ late end date \nDrag the offering bar back to the end of the longest visible\
    \ role \nObserve the warning modal \nConfirm \nAdd Completed Roles to the Include\
    \ filter \nObserve that,\n \nin accordance with prophecy,\n the Completed role's\
    \ plans were trimmed."

  title: Update default Project Offerings shown on user Timesheet
  description: "WHO: \nAs a time tracking user \nWHAT: \nI want to only see relevant\
    \ offerings on my timesheet \nWHY: \nSo my timesheet is easy to read and use,\
    \ and I am only looking at the projects relevant to me for the week I am entering\
    \ time. \n \nDefault view: \nUser is assigned to project + offering for the current\
    \ week (has plans) \nUser logged time to project + offering the last week - uncertain\
    \ of how we can achieve this \n \nThis logic should account for not needing to\
